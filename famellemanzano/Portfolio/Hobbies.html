    <p2>My Hobbies: <br><br>
        Playing games for both Online and Offline. Especially Gacha Games <br>
        Also FPS games like Valorant <br>
        I also workout in order to stay fit. Although I don't go to gym nor run outside, <br>
        I pretty much use an application for my workout routine.
        <br>
        <br>
        I also like watching memes and guides for particular games. Mostly I get lazy <br>
        and just watching some gameplays and copy or mimic them. 
        <br>
        <br>
        On that note, I also copy or mimic moves from the videos I watching. I don't know if it's <br>
        a good thing or not. But it's fun.
